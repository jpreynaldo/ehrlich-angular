How to use the web app on your local

1. You need to copy the https link of the repository first so can clone it from your local

2. So from your local, open your git bash, locate to your preferred directory, and run this code "git clone [git url]"
3. After that, go to your editor (I assume its VS Code), open the folder, and run the terminal
4. From the terminal, you need to run the "npm i" code since all library that I used on this app is from the web pack and need to be installed
5. After that, on the same terminal, hit the "npm start" code and wait a moment until the web app is automatically opened on your default browser
6. To use the app, follow the demo guide that I provided for this.
